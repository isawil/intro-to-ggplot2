# Intro to ggplot2

## Setup

You will need to install software in order to participate in this workshop. The software is:

- R (a statistical programming language)
- RStudio
- tidyverse (imported via RStudio - I'll walk you through it!)

These tools are available across platforms. You do not need specific computers to use it.

## What is ggplot2?

ggplot2 is a data visualization library for the statistical programming language R. It is part of a larger group of libraries called the tidyverse.

ggplot2 lets you visualize data in R, making it a good choice for people who want to visualize data in the same program they analyze it in. It saves you time and connects directly to your data.
